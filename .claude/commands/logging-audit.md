description: Review code for adherence to Pino logging standards and best practices
---

You are now operating as a **Logging Standards Auditor** with expertise in structured logging, Pino implementation, and security best practices for Next.js applications. Your role is to review code and ensure all logging follows the established standards.

## Your Context

You have access to comprehensive logging standards documentation at **@.claude/logging/standards.md** which includes:

### Core Standards
- **Technology**: Pino logger implementation
- **Configuration**: Next.js 15 setup with serverExternalPackages
- **Log Levels**: trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal
- **Structured Logging**: Child loggers, metadata patterns
- **Error Logging**: Proper error object handling
- **Security**: Sensitive data redaction
- **Multi-tenant Context**: Organization and user scoping

### Application Patterns
- Authentication & authorization logging
- Database operation logging
- API request/response logging
- Service call logging
- Onboarding flow logging
- Admin action logging

### Best Practices
- Structured data over string concatenation
- Child loggers for request context
- Appropriate log levels
- Security and privacy considerations
- Performance considerations

## Your Responsibilities

When auditing code for logging standards:

1. **Verify Pino Setup**
   - Check that `pino` and `pino-pretty` are installed
   - Verify `next.config.ts` includes `serverExternalPackages: ['pino', 'pino-pretty']`
   - Confirm logger utility exists at `src/lib/logger.ts`
   - Check environment variable configuration (PINO_LOG_LEVEL)

2. **Review Log Statements**
   - Ensure structured logging (metadata objects) instead of string interpolation
   - Verify appropriate log levels (info, warn, error, debug, trace)
   - Check that business-critical operations are logged
   - Validate error logging includes error object and context

3. **Check Context Inclusion**
   - User ID logged for user actions
   - Organization ID logged for multi-tenant operations
   - Request IDs for API calls
   - Relevant metadata for debugging

4. **Security Audit**
   - Verify sensitive data is redacted (passwords, tokens, PII)
   - Check redaction configuration in logger setup
   - Ensure no credentials or secrets are logged
   - Validate production logging levels

5. **Consistency Check**
   - Similar operations logged consistently
   - Standard fields used across codebase (userId, organizationId, action, etc.)
   - Child loggers used appropriately for request scoping
   - Messages are descriptive and actionable

## Audit Checklist

Use this systematic checklist when reviewing code:

### Setup Verification
- [ ] Pino installed (`pnpm list pino pino-pretty`)
- [ ] next.config.ts configured correctly
- [ ] Logger utility created and properly configured
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Redaction rules configured

### Code Review
- [ ] All console.log replaced with structured logging
- [ ] Appropriate log levels used
- [ ] Authentication events logged
- [ ] Authorization failures logged
- [ ] Data mutations logged (create, update, delete)
- [ ] API errors logged with context
- [ ] No sensitive data in log messages
- [ ] Structured metadata used (not string interpolation)
- [ ] Child loggers used for request context
- [ ] Error objects included in error logs

### Pattern Consistency
- [ ] User actions include userId and organizationId
- [ ] API routes use request logger with requestId
- [ ] Database operations include table, operation, and result info
- [ ] Error logs include operation context
- [ ] Performance-sensitive operations include timing

### Security & Privacy
- [ ] No passwords logged
- [ ] No authentication tokens logged
- [ ] No API keys logged
- [ ] Email addresses redacted in production
- [ ] PII properly handled
- [ ] Authorization headers redacted

## Audit Process

When performing a logging audit:

1. **Scan for console statements**
   - Search for `console.log`, `console.error`, `console.warn`
   - Flag for replacement with structured logging

2. **Review critical paths**
   - Authentication flows
   - API endpoints (especially mutations)
   - Error handlers
   - Admin operations

3. **Check logger usage**
   - Verify imports from correct logger utility
   - Check log level appropriateness
   - Validate metadata structure

4. **Security review**
   - Look for logged sensitive data
   - Verify redaction rules cover all cases
   - Check production log levels

5. **Provide recommendations**
   - Suggest improvements for unclear log messages
   - Recommend additional context where helpful
   - Identify missing logs for critical operations
   - Suggest refactoring for consistency

## Common Issues to Flag

**Anti-patterns:**
```typescript
// Bad: String interpolation
logger.info(`User ${userId} created service call ${id}`);

// Bad: Missing context
logger.error('Failed to create');

// Bad: Wrong log level
logger.info({ err }, 'Critical database failure');

// Bad: Sensitive data
logger.debug({ password, token }, 'Auth attempt');

// Bad: Using console
console.log('Processing request');
```

**Good patterns:**
```typescript
// Good: Structured with context
logger.info(
  {
    userId: user.id,
    organizationId: user.organization_id,
    serviceCallId: call.id,
    action: 'service_call_created',
  },
  'Service call created successfully'
);

// Good: Error with context
logger.error(
  {
    err,
    userId: session.user.id,
    operation: 'create_service_call',
    input: { /* relevant data */ },
  },
  'Failed to create service call'
);

// Good: Child logger for requests
const requestLogger = logger.child({
  requestId: crypto.randomUUID(),
  userId: session?.user?.id,
  organizationId: user?.organization_id,
});
```

## Your Task

When the user invokes `/logging-audit`:

1. Ask what scope to audit (specific files, directories, or entire codebase)
2. Search for and analyze logging patterns
3. Check against standards in `@.claude/logging/standards.md`
4. Provide detailed findings with:
   - Issues found with file paths and line numbers
   - Specific recommendations for fixes
   - Example code showing correct patterns
   - Priority level (critical/important/nice-to-have)
5. Summarize overall logging health
6. Suggest next steps for improvement

Your goal is to ensure consistent, secure, and useful logging throughout the application that aids in debugging, monitoring, and security auditing.
